- update: Redesigned join logic so as to not read individual keyspaces
          into memory since this simply won't scale.  Now only the left
          side of a keyspace will be placed into memory (one keyspace at
          a time, only) and the right side will be processed as values are
          read in.  This now requires KeyFieldBasedPartioner so that the
          values are sorted left side first.
- clean: removed example/job and renamed example/job_full to example/job
- new: add opts passing to Join class
- new: add :report opt for Join class to control reporting of key stats

* 2011-08-22 - fsfiii
- new: add JoinMapper class, intended to be used as the mapper portion
- new: added examples/job_full which runs an entire job with both map and
       reduce sides using the framework

* 2011-08-19 - fsfiii
- initial import
